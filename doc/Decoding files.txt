How to decode the Bryton route files:
.fit
Work in progress, see TestTrack5-1.fit file

.smy
Header file with general information for route
2 bytes reserved (0100)
	4 bytes number os points
		  4 bytes lat bounding box NE
		            4 bytes lat bounding box SW
		                      4 bytes lon bounding box NE
		                                4 bytes lon bounding box SW
		                                          4 bytes distance
		                                          			4 bytes TBD? (appears to always end in FE)

.zinfo
Header file indicating number o .zmap files
6 bytes header (hard coded 0300 0000 0c00)
			   2 bytes number of files
				    2 total bytes number of points
				    	 2 bytes reserved 0000
				    	 	  2 bytes number of points shifted 1 to the left(ex.: 1200 -> 2001, 1234 -> 2341)
				    	 	  	   2 bytes reserved 0000
										4 bytes first file (hard coded ba05 0000 9906 0000)
															4 bytes second file (hard coded b905 0000 9906 0000)

.zmap
File indicating all points that form the described route
4 bytes latitude *1000000
		  4 bytes longitude *1000000
		  			4 bytes altitude
		  					  4 bytes point identification

.tinfo
File indicating all turn and POI information along route
4 bytes point identification (a long route will have points without instructions)
     4 bytes direction instruction (01 go ahead, 02 turn right, 21 end of route, ...) , after end of route indicates POI number (65 peak, 68 Checkpoint, 66 Food, 64 General)
       	  8 bytes distance in lane TBD better describe this attribute
                    8 bytes TBD?
							      32 bytes lane identification (street blablabla)

TBD:
	-	Why .zmap is sometimes divided in 2 or more ?
	-	Add indication of data size and file size
